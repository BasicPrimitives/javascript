# Zoom using Item template
Usage of CSS scale transform produce ugly results in many browsers, so the best solution for zooming is sizing of chart with item templates. It gives us two advantages:

1. We can tune our CSS styles, so we can be sure that text is readable at any zoom level we provide.
2. We automatically change content of items at different zoom levels. 

See item template use case for more details about templates usage.
