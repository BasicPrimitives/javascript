| Param | Type | Default | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
 | `name` | string | `` | name | 

### Properties
| Name | Type | Default | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
 | `annotations` | Array.<(ShapeAnnotationConfi | `[]` | Annotations. Annotations are API elements attached to the diagram nodes and designed to highlight some nodes or relations. We draw our annotations either in front of the nodes or in the background. The annotations don't affect the placement of the nodes in any way. We have some exceptions. As a result, the control redraws them instantaneously without rendering or recalculating the actual diagram layout. | 
 | `cursorItem` | string | `null` | Cursor item. Organization Chart control has API options equivalent to standard UI controls. The cursor item is used to select a single item in the hierarchy with a mouse click, and the highlighted item provides visual feedback on the mouse over. Selected items collection is equivalent to checked items in ListView or TreeView controls. The chart's navigation work around the current cursor item. The component shows the cursor and its neighbors regardless of page fit mode. So cursor item plays the role of local zoom in the chart hierarchy. The user navigates around the chart via clicking and selecting cursor items and zooming into data around the new cursor item. The control notifies about this property changes with `onCursorChanging` and `onCursorChanged` events. If the cursor item is set to null, then no cursor item is selected in the diagram. | 
 | `emptyDiagramMessage` | string | `"Diagram is empty."` | Empty diagram message. This option is supposed to say user that chart is empty when no data is available for rendering. | 
 | `enablePanning` | boolean | `true` | Enable panning. Enable chart panning with mouse drag & drop for desktop browsers. Disable it if you need to support items Drag & Drop. | 
 | `hasSelectorCheckbox` | Enabled | `Auto` | Sets visibility of selection check boxes for the diagram nodes. `Auto` - visible for cursor item only `True` - visible `False` - hidden See `selectedItems` property. All items listed in this property are going to have checked selection checkboxes. Checkbox can be added to item template, in that case it should be named="checkbox", so control can use it as built in checkbox element. | 
 | `highlightGravityRadius` | number | `40` | Highlight gravity radius. This property controls mouse over feedback and callout annotation visibility for nodes rendered as markers when diagram auto fits nodes into available screen space. It makes marker highlighted when mouse pointer is inside of the gravity radius cycle of the marker. This property is ignored when the nearest item is outside of the screen boundaries and is not visible to the end user. The normal item has mouse over feedback in form of highlight border only when mouse pointer is inside of its boundaries. | 
 | `highlightItem` | string | `null` | Highlighted item. Shows highlight and callout annotation for given item id. It does not trigger diagram layout or scrolling so it can be used to synchronize mouse over feedback of the diagram nodes with other collection controls or UI elements. The control notifies about this property changes with `onHighlightChanging` and `onHighlightChanged` events. If `null` then no highlight shown on the diagram. | 
 | `items` | OrgItemConfig[] | `[]` | Items collection. Ths property defines data we render in the diagram. Every item should have set unique `id` property. They are used to create relations between items in the diagram and for rendering of various UI elements bound to nodes. | 
 | `navigationMode` | NavigationMode | `Default` | Sets control navigation mode. By default control replicates interactivity of regular collection control. It has cursor to select single item in the collection. So user can click and select any node in the diagram. The control has highlight for mouse over feedback. So user can move mouse and see highlight frame and callout callback annotation for node under cursor. By `Default` the control has both cursor and highlight. If they are disabled then control is rendered as a static image. | 
 | `scale` | number | `1` | CSS3 scale transform. Control supports content scaling using CSS scale transform. It scales everything except scroll bars. It properly handles mouse event coordinates. The CSS scale transform produces unreadable text and corrupted lines in desktop browsers, it looks good only in mobile browsers, so our recommendation is to use zoom with collection of item templates of various sizes. Templates gives you better control over quality of your content at various zoom levels. | 
 | `selectedItems` | string[] | `[]` | Selected items collection. Selected items is a collection of items ids having checked their check boxes. The control always shows selected items in the full size form, regardless of enabled page fit mode. The control notifies about user made changes in this collection with `onSelectionChanging` and `onSelectionChanged` events. | 

### Auto Layout Properties
| Name | Type | Default | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
 | `alignBranches` | boolean | `false` | Enables cross branch nodes alignment. Places the same type of nodes across all branches of the diagram at the same level. | 
 | `autoSizeMaximum` | Size | `{1024, 768}` | Sets maximum size the diagram can expand itself in auto size mode. See `pageFitMode` property. In the auto size mode diagram controls its placeholder size itself, it sets its size to accommodate all nodes and render them normally. | 
 | `autoSizeMinimum` | Size | `{800, 600}` | Sets minimum size the diagram can shrink itself in auto size mode. See `pageFitMode` property. In the auto size mode diagram controls its placeholder size itself, it sets its size to accommodate all nodes and render them normally. | 
 | `childrenPlacementType` | ChildrenPlacementType | `Horizontal` | Sets default formation of child nodes. By default all children that belong to a parent node are always aligned below and placed in a horizontal line. On a large scale this may result in the end user having to scroll screens in order to view all of the nodes. To compensate for this, we provide the option of placing all of the children of a parent node in a square/matrix formation. This will reduce sideways screen scrolling by compacting the child nodes into a much smaller area on the screen. | 
 | `horizontalAlignment` | HorizontalAlignmentType | `Center` | Sets children horizontal alignment relative to their parent. The children by default are measured in size and then aligned towards the parent node. If it is `Center` aligned then parent node is placed in the middle of the children. In the `Left` alignment mode parent is aligned to left of the children and vice versa for `Right` alignment. | 
 | `leavesPlacementType` | ChildrenPlacementType | `Horizontal` | Sets formation of leave children. | 
 | `maximumColumnsInMatrix` | number | `6` | Maximum number of columns for matrix layout of children. | 
 | `minimalVisibility` | Visibility | `Dot` | Minimal nodes visibility in the diagram. If auto fit of the diagram into current page size is enabled, then this option controls minimum allowed size of the diagram nodes. | 
 | `minimumVisibleLevels` | number | `1` | Minimum visible levels option prevents top-level nodes from folding into markers. The option accounts for organizational chart relations and `levelOffset` of individual items. | 
 | `orientationType` | OrientationType | `Top` | Set diagram orientation. This option controls diagram layout orientation. The control can be rotated in any direction, this is needed for Arabic support and various layouts. | 
 | `pageFitMode` | PageFitMode | `FitToPage` | Page fit mode. Minimizing nodes into markers and labels. This option provides a special mode that renders the diagram nodes in the form of markers. This is a highly scalable form that is capable of rendering large numbers of nodes while not affecting the rendering performance. With this, huge diagrams can be fit into available screen space. When using a graphics editor to manually draw your diagrams, it is common place to have large gaps between the nodes. This can make the diagram/chart unreadable, hard to edit and navigate. On top of that, on a large scale the diagram could have screen size intervals between items. Admittedly the computer UI does allow the user to scale and fit the diagram in order to visualize it on a single screen. But in that case, the items become small and unreadable as there is no scaling priority and the items are just too small to be readable. | 
 | `placeAdvisersAboveChildren` | boolean | `true` | Sets default placement of advisers hierarchies relative to the regular children of the parent node. If adviser node has its own children then control adds extra levels, so advisers children are placed above level of the parent node children. | 
 | `placeAssistantsAboveChildren` | boolean | `true` | Sets default placement of assistants hierarchies relative to the regular children of the parent node. If assistant node has its own children then control adds extra levels, so assistants children are placed above level of the parent node children. | 
 | `selectionPathMode` | SelectionPathMode | `FullStack` | Selection path mode. This property controls visibility of nodes between cursor and the root of the diagram in the auto fit mode. It allows to draw them in full size regardless of available space and auto fit mode. The control supports diagram auto fit into screen view. It is achieved via drawing nodes in form of markers. So small nodes make diagram fit into the screen space, but they have no details. Our solution is to show cursor and selected items of the diagram in full size and draw all other diagram nodes as markers. | 
 | `verticalAlignment` | VerticalAlignmentType | `Middle` | Sets items vertical alignment relative to each other within one level of the hierarchy. It does not change anything if diagram nodes are all of the same size. |

 | `showLabels` | Enabled | `Auto` | Sets labels visibility for nodes when they are minimized into markers by page auto fit. See `pageFitMode` property. The control does not preserve space for labels in the diagram layout, since that would contradict the purpose of minimizing the nodes into markers. Use controls `dotLevelShift`, `dotItemsInterval` properties to preserve space between nodes for labels. Labels are displayed inside of `div`s of the fixed size, see `labelSize` property, and control provides simple conflict resolution to avoid labels overlapping. If two labels overlap each other with their bounding rectangles then only one of them is going to stay visible. Auto - displays label only when it has space to be rendered. True - shows label regardless, even if it overlaps other labels and nodes. False - hidden. |

 | `hasButtons` | Enabled | `Auto` | Sets buttons visibility. `Auto` - cursor item only. `True` - visible `False` - hidden | 
 | `itemTitleFirstFontColor` | string | `Colors.White` | The first font color of the title. The title background color is designed to be one of the available dimensions to group nodes in the diagram, so title can be unreadable if its color matches its background color. This property is created to auto resolve this issue via automatic switch between two available font title colors. | 
 | `itemTitleSecondFontColor` | string | `Colors.Navy` | The second font color of the title. | 
 | `minimizedItemShapeType` | ShapeType | `None` | Markers. The shape of the markers when nodes are minimized by auto fit. The control supports auto fit of the diagram into available screen space. When the diagram size significantly larger than available screen space, its scrolling and navigation becomes problematic, so control supports automatic diagram fit into the screen space via rendering some of its nodes in form of small markers. So this option sets default marker shape for nodes. It can be set individually per node in items configurations. The default color of shape is the same as `itemTitleColor` property set for individual items. | 
 | `selectCheckBoxLabel` | string | `"Selected"` | Selection check box label. See `hasSelectorCheckbox` and `selectedItems` properties. | 
 | `templates` | TemplateConfig[] | `[]` | Collection of named templates used to define content for nodes, cursor and highlight. By default control provides templates for all types of visual elements. |

## <a name="OrgItemConfig" id="OrgItemConfig">OrgItemConfig</a>
Item Configuration Object defines properties of individual node in the organizational chart hierarchy. See `items` collection property of organizational chart control configuration object.

 `OrgItemConfig` 

### Constructor

 `OrgItemConfig(arg0, arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4)` 

Item Configuration Object defines properties of individual node in the organizational chart hierarchy. See `items` collection property of organizational chart control configuration object.

| Param | Type | Default | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
 | `arg0` | OrgItemConfig | `` | Item config properties | 
 | `arg0` | string | `` | Item id | 
 | `arg1` | string | `` | Parent id | 
 | `arg2` | string | `` | Title | 
 | `arg3` | string | `` | Description | 
 | `arg4` | string | `` | Image | 

### Properties
| Name | Type | Default | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
 | `adviserPlacementType` | AdviserPlacementType | `Auto` | Defines leftward or rightward item placement relative to the parent item. By default it is `Auto` and depends on general diagram layout orientation. | 
 | `childrenPlacementType` | ChildrenPlacementType | `Auto` | The property defines children's layout formation. By default, control places children in a horizontal line below the parent node. On a large scale, this may result in the end-user having to scroll screens to view all nodes. To compensate for this, we place children in a square/matrix formation. That will reduce sideways screen scrolling by compacting the child nodes into a much smaller area on the screen. | 
 | `hasSelectorCheckbox` | Enabled | `Auto` | Shows selection check box for the node. If Auto then selection check box visibility depends on control's configuration. Auto - depends on `hasSelectorCheckbox` property of the control True - shown False - hidden | 
 | `id` | string | `null` | Item id. It should be unique per chart. | 
 | `isActive` | boolean | `true` | If true it makes item inactive in the diagram layout. Inactive items are regular items excluded from navigation, that means when diagram uses auto fit mode, selection of the neighboring nodes goes through inactive items, so all nodes next to inactive item become selected and shown in full size as well. Inactive items play a role of in layout annotations having no user interaction and templated with HTML. For example they can be used to add titles into family diagram layout or terminator items indicating that upon reaching them diagram would load extra nodes into layout. | 
 | `isVisible` | boolean | `true` | If `false` it makes item invisible in the layout. If item has no visible parents then its connections are hidden as well. From navigation perspective invisible items make all their children to be children of their parents. | 
 | `itemType` | ItemType | `Regular` | Item type. This property defines child node placement relative to its parent node. By default all children that belong to a parent node are of the same rank and status between each other and due to that, are always aligned below the parent and are organized in the same way. However for special cases were the end user wishes to have a child that is separate from the rest of it's siblings, we provide custom child types that the end user can use to place different ranking nodes anywhere around the parent node. These placement options give a lot of space for the creation of roles such as an Assistant, Adviser, various Partners and co-heads that may be in the organization. Additionally, by default `Regular` children are always placed in a horizontal line below the parent node. | 
 | `levelOffset` | number | `null` | Sets node level offset relative to parent node. This property is ignored if it is not applicable. | 
 | `parent` | string | `null` | Parent item id. If `null` then node is the root item of the hierarchy. | 
 | `placeAdvisersAboveChildren` | Enabled | `Auto` | The property sets default placement of advisers hierarchies relative to the regular children of the node. If the adviser node has its children, then control adds extra levels, so the adviser's children are placed above the regular children. | 
 | `placeAssistantsAboveChildren` | Enabled | `Auto` | The property sets the default placement of assistants hierarchies relative to the regular children of the node. If the assistant node has its children, then control adds extra levels, so the assistant's children are placed above the regular children. | 

### Callout Properties
| Name | Type | Default | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
 | `calloutTemplateName` | string | `null` | Callout annotation template name. This option lets individually assign rendering callout annotation template per individual node of the diagram. Templates are HTML fragments containing layout and styles used to render diagram nodes. They are defined with a named configuration objects. See `templates` property of control's configuration object. | 
 | `showCallout` | Enabled | `Auto` | Sets callout annotation visibility for individual node. The callout annotation is one of easy to use features of the control. By default it is displayed for markers in order to preview their node's content. The content is displayed using current template of the node it is rendered for. The callout can be forced to be displayed for regular nodes as well. In that case use `calloutTemplateName` property to change their template. Auto - depends on `showCallout` property of the control True - shown regardless of node's visibility False - hidden | 

### Group Title Properties
| Name | Type | Default | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
 | `groupTitle` | string | `null` | Group Title. The group title on the side of the diagram node is one of controls default easy to use features. It gives extra dimension for nodes visual grouping in the diagram. | 
 | `groupTitleColor` | string | `Colors.RoyalBlue` | The group title background color. | 

### Label Properties
| Name | Type | Default | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
 | `label` | string | `null` | Marker label. | 
 | `labelOrientation` | TextOrientationType | `Auto` | Label orientation. If `Auto` then it is set to `labelOrientation` property of the control configuration. | 
 | `labelPlacement` | PlacementType | `Auto` | Label placement. Sets label placement relative to the marker bounding rectangle. If `Auto` then it is set to `labelPlacement` of the control configuration. | 
 | `labelSize` | Size | `null` | Label size. Sets label's placeholder `div` size and controls conflict resolution if labels overlap each other. If `null` then it is set to `labelSize` property of the control configuration. | 
 | `showLabel` | Enabled | `Auto` | Sets label visibility for individual nodes. Labels are only rendered for a node's markers. The control does not preserve space for labels in the diagram layout, since that would contradict the purpose of minimizing the nodes into markers. Use controls `dotLevelShift`, `dotItemsInterval` properties to preserve space between nodes for labels. Labels are displayed inside of `div`s of the fixed size, see `labelSize` property, and control provides simple conflict resolution to avoid labels overlapping. If two labels overlap each other with their bounding rectangles then only one of them is going to stay visible. Auto - displays label only when it has space to be rendered. True - shows label regardless, even if it overlaps other labels and nodes. False - hidden. | 

### Template Properties
| Name | Type | Default | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
 | `context` | object | `null` | Context object | 
 | `description` | string | `null` | Description | 
 | `hasButtons` | Enabled | `Auto` | Shows context buttons panel for the node. If Auto then context buttons panel visibility depends on control's configuration. Auto - depends on `hasButtons` property of the control True - shown False - hidden | 
 | `image` | string | `null` | Image | 
 | `itemTitleColor` | string | `Colors.RoyalBlue` | Title background color. The same color is used for node marker when control has enabled auto fit mode. | 
 | `minimizedItemShapeType` | ShapeType | `null` | Marker type. The shape of the marker when node is minimized by auto fit. The control supports auto fit of diagram into available screen space. When diagram size significantly larger than available screen space, its scrolling and navigation becomes problematic, so control supports automatic diagram fit into the screen space via rendering some of its nodes in form of small markers. So this option sets marker shape for individual node. | 
 | `templateName` | string | `null` | Template name. Templates are HTML fragments containing layout and styles used to render diagram nodes. They are defined with a named configuration objects. See `templates` property of control's configuration object. This option lets individually assign rendering template per individual node of the diagram. | 
 | `title` | string | `null` | Title | 

## <a name="OrgEventArgs" id="OrgEventArgs">OrgEventArgs</a>
Context object

 `OrgEventArgs` 

### Properties
| Name | Type | Default | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
 | `cancel` | boolean | `false` | If true cancels subsequent event and layout update. | 
 | `context` | string | `null` | New item | 
 | `name` | string | `null` | Relative object name. | 
 | `oldContext` | string | `null` | Current item | 
 | `position` | Rect | `null` | Node position on the diagram. |
